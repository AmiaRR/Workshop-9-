# Workshop-9- 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-9-/

For this task I used live video capture in a sketch. It took me many attempts to get the webcam to work, and I used the assistance of ChatGPT promts to help resolve this. I also used ChatGPT to create the triangles in my sketch. I could have improved my sketch with further experimentation of different shapes in my sketch and by solving how to make the triangles go to the edge of the canvas.
